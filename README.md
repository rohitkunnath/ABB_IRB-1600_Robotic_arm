# ABB IRB 1600 – Pick and Place Simulation (RobotStudio)

This project showcases an ABB IRB 1600 industrial robotic arm performing an automated **pick-and-place operation** in RobotStudio.  
The robot picks a box from a source location and places it onto a table while maintaining **collision-free motion**, ensuring it does not touch any walls or surrounding objects.
